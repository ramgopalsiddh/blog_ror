Validations - text references
-----------------------------------------------------------------
You can view the code added for the validations to the article model 
here: https://github.com/udemyrailscourse/alpha-blog-6/commit/2efe9c071f85659bdb3e023871c55433d2a253bd

Validations enforce constraints on your model so you can have greater control on 
what you are allowing as data to be saved in your database/tables.


sytex for validations 

class Article < ApplicationRecord
  validates :title, presence: true, length: { minimum: 6, maximum: 100 }
  validates :description, presence: true, length: { minimum: 10, maximum: 300 }
end

In this we validates presence and minimum & maximum length of title and description.
