The index action in a controller is used to display a summarized listing of all the 
items in a table. If there are big blog posts as each item, then the index would 
usually contain either a summary of the post or a few hundred characters that link 
to the actual post.

Examples:

- articles listing

- users listing

- friends listing

- stocks listing

- photos listing

- listing of people you are following on IG etc.

All the code added to build this - route, controller/action, view template is provided
 in the link at the beginning of this text resource.
