Forms - new article form text reference
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
To create a new article from the browser (front-end), you'll need a form to get input from the user. Since we're dealing with articles which have title and description, you want to give the user an ability to fill-in the title and description of the article they are trying to create. The form is displayed via the new route/action and the form submission is handled by the create action.

First you'll need to expose these two routes in the config/routes.rb file, so the file looks like below:

Rails.application.routes.draw do   root 'pages#home'   get 'about', to: 'pages#about'   resources :articles, only: [:show, :index, :new, :create] end

You will need to add the new and create actions in the articles_controller.rb file like below:

def new
end
 
def create 
end  

You will also need to create a view template for the new view. So, in the app/views/articles folder create a new file called new.html.erb and fill it in like below:


<h1> Create a new Article </h1>

<%= form_with scope: :article, url: articles_path, local: true, data: {turbo: false }  do |f| %>
  <p>
    <%= f.label :title %><br>
    <%= f.text_field :title %>
  </p>

  <p>
    <%= f.label :description %><br>
    <%= f.text_area :description %>
  </p>

  <p>
    <%= f.submit %>
  </p>

<% end %>
