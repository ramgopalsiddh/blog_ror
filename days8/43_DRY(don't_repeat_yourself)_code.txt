DRY code - text references
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself - code can be accomplished by refactoring or 'extracting away 
code redundancies'. We accomplished a significant amount of this by using a couple of private
 methods in our articles controller and using partials in our views. Clean code should always 
 be a priority once features are built and working as we want so that our code is easy to read
  and easily maintainable. All changes we made to the application during the video can be
