Edit and update - text references and code
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The process of editing an existing article and updating the article in the articles table 
utilizes the edit and update actions. The standard process is as follows:

1. Expose edit and update routes.

2. Add edit and and update actions in the articles controller.

3. Create an edit template (form) in the app/views/articles folder.

4. Use the edit action to find the article to edit, display the existing article 
details in the edit form.

5. Use the update action to find the article in the db. Whitelist the new title and 
description fields and if there are no validation errors, then update the article in 
the articles table with the new data.

The completed code added in the video for the entire process can be found
