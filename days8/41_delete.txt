Delete articles - text references
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Deleting articles can be accomplished using the destroy action in the articles controller. 
The standard deletion process would look like below:

1. Expose the destroy route.

2. Add the destroy action in the articles controller.

3. Find the article to delete and delete it using the destroy method within the destroy action.

All the code added in the video for the destroy action can be found
