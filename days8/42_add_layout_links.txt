Layout links: text references
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We added a lot of links to the application in order to perform all the actions for articles,
 along with adding the ability to navigate around the application. These were accomplished 
 using layout links. All code changes/additions made during the video to cleanup the look of 
 the application can be found
