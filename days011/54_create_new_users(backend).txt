----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The code changes made in the previous video can be found 
here: https://github.com/udemyrailscourse/alpha-blog-6/commit/30ed763aa9d01c4bb308ee9c5bbc8ef8cae8f6dc

Summary of changes made (refer to the commit link for specific code):

- Add create action and user_params method in users controller.

- Update shared errors partial to display the appropriate class name (instead of hard-coded article).

- Link the "Sign up!" button in the home page (app/views/pages/home.html.erb) to go to this new signup path.

You can test out the functionality by signing up a few users from the browser and then ensuring 
their presence in the users table (you can check this using the rails console).
