Alter object state before_save - text directions
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the video we used the before_save method to change emails entered to lowercase before 
saving them to the database. To accomplish this we added the line before to our user model:

before_save { self.email = email.downcase }

The code change made in the video can be found in the commit
