Summary of changes:

- Generated a functional categories controller test file using the following command: 

rails generate test_unit:scaffold category

- Modified the file to only test for new, index and show urls for now.

- Added the actions and templates so the tests pass, and in turn have the new, show and index templates ready to go.
