Summary of changes:

- Added functionality for users to delete their own accounts using a destroy method
 in the users controller.

- Added a link to delete account to the users' profile dropdown navigation option.

- Utilized a couple of existing methods (as before_action methods) to secure the
 newly created destroy action at controller level.
