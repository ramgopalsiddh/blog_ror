Summary of changes:

- White-list category ids in article_params method of the articles controller.


- Add select box for categories to _form.html.erb (form partial) used for articles
 (views/articles/_form.html.erb).


If you want to use checkboxes instead of the select box we used to display/select categories,
 you can reference the code used in the Rails 5 version of the app
  here: https://github.com/udemyrailscourse/alpha-blog-11-2017-5.1.4/blob/master/app/views/articles/_form.html.erb


Note: If you do select this option to use the previous version using checkboxes, make sure you use the
 appropriate classes for styling from Bootstrap (the version used in the repo is Bootstrap 3).
